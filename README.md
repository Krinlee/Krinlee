- 👋 Hi, I’m @Krinlee
- 👀 I’m interested in ... learning new things. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Python. It is a journey I started last year and have been having a blast. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... new fun ideas for things to code.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Twitter @MrKrinle

I'm starting this Github right now as a main place to keep different projects that I'm working on, and store previous projects that I've finished.
I figure if I'm going to keep learning and working with code I may as well keep a record of any of my projects and successes so that if I need
it for anything here it is. Also hopefully (if need be) I hope to be able to utilize this in a resume.
